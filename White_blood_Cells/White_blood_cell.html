<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Medical Image Analysis is a widely used method to screen and diagnose diseases. Depending of the part or tissue of the body would check, we can subset imaging Technics into 2 big methods. First the methods that use rays, like x-ray, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) or Scintigraphy. In general, the images generated by these methods are as a photographic film (black and white). The advantage of these methods is that we can observe body through tissues and have access to internal parts without chirurgy. The inconvenient is that these methods uses ionizing radiation (dangerous for health) and mainly expensive. There are at less two kaggle competition with this type of images: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/data">NIH Chest X-rays</a> and <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia">Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)</a> The second kind of medical imaging is applied to all type of tissues or physiological fluid (plasma, blood). The samples are prepared on glass slide and stained with Hematoxylin and eosin stain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%26E_stain">(H&amp;E)</a>. This technique is very old and widely used for several medical screening and diagnostics. H&amp;E staining is not expensive but needs Human intervention and the processing takes a while. The interpretation of the images also needs multiple experts (pathologist) to visualize and diagnose slides mainly through microscopes. the analysis remains subjective and could differ between pathologists.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the H&amp;E stains are routinely prepared by technicians who become overwhelmed by the increasing number of samples. Likewise, pathologists are over-worked by the microscopic observation and interpretation, causing overflow that may result in diagnostic error.</p>
<div id="motivation" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Motivation</h2>
<p>A computational grading of slides using learning machine may help to make a pre-screening a hundred or thousand or slides before Human verification.</p>

<p>The images of this competition shows blood cell spread on glass slide and stained by H&amp;E method. We can visualize red blood cell and immune cells. It is easy to make a difference between these two kind of cells. The coloration is not the same, red cells are red but immune cell are purple.</p>

<p>We converted an example of xml file to dataframe. We find intersting information about the x,y coordinates of cells.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>bndbox</code> column show the x and y limits of the annotations. We need to extract xmin, ymin, xmax, and ymax.</p></li>
<li><p><code>name</code> column indicates the type of cells.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here the coordonate of multiple RBC are poorly represented. We observe a cancatenation of 4 coordinates: xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax.</p>
<p>I opened multiple xml file and I did not find WBC cell with its x, y limits.</p>
<p>You can use <code>extract_square_of_WBC(&quot;dataset-master/Annotations/BloodImage_00019.xml&quot;)</code> function and change the name of the image.</p>
<p>The output does not have WCB sample. In actual document the code was run with the dataset download from github.</p>

<ul>
<li>Mainly we have one WBC for each image BUT some image have two type of WBC. for example image 10 has two WCB (BloodImage_00010.xml).</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next step we need to add annotation/type of each WBC. The annotation is in the dataframe named <code>WBC_seprate_multiple_label</code> (see above).</p>

<li>At this step We can avoid image with two kinds of WBC.</li>
<li>We can crop all WBC and get our unicellular dataset.</li>
